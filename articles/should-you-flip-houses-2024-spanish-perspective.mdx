## Introduction

Flipping houses in Spain has always been a viable investment strategy, and in 2024, the market remains attractive—albeit with some caveats. As we enter a year shaped by regional disparities and shifting economic policies, the question is not whether you can flip houses, but whether you should—and how to do it wisely. This report takes a closer look at the Spanish property market from an investment perspective, using the PAS framework (Problem, Agitation, Solution) to analyze why flipping houses is still a smart move in 2024, provided you conduct the right due diligence.

## Problem: Market Complexity and Rising Costs

In 2024, the Spanish property market faces challenges. Rising mortgage rates (with the Euribor currently at 4%) and construction costs are pushing many potential buyers, especially first-time buyers, to pause their plans (Costa Capital) (Dream Property Marbella). Moreover, demand for ready-to-move properties outpaces supply, especially in popular regions like the Costa del Sol, Barcelona, and Madrid (Idealista). Investors must navigate these complexities carefully, as inflated purchase prices and expensive renovation materials can eat into potential profits (Dream Property Marbella).

Further complicating the market is the wide regional variation in property values. For instance, property prices in high-demand areas like the Balearic Islands and Costa Blanca have seen a jump of up to 24% year-on-year (Olive Press News Spain). Meanwhile, other regions, such as Murcia and inland locations, present more moderate price increases, making them more attractive for flipping (Costa Capital) (Dream Property Marbella).

## Agitation: Pressure on Investors

For investors, these market dynamics create a perfect storm of challenges. While Spain remains a popular destination for both foreign and domestic buyers, the cost of financing is expected to stay high throughout 2024. Investors need to be prepared for larger down payments and must carefully monitor interest rate fluctuations (Dream Property Marbella) (Affidata).

There’s also pressure from the changing profile of property buyers in Spain. Post-pandemic, many buyers are affluent foreign investors who have greater liquidity and are less reliant on financing. This means competition for desirable properties can be fierce, pushing up prices even further (Idealista). At the same time, the secondary market—traditionally a prime hunting ground for flips—has been somewhat “drained” due to the high sales volume over the past few years (Olive Press News Spain).

## Solution: A Strategy for Successful Flipping in 2024

Despite the challenges, flipping houses in Spain can still be a highly profitable venture in 2024, especially if you employ the right strategy and due diligence.

### Target Emerging or Underdeveloped Areas

While popular markets like Madrid, Barcelona, and coastal areas may offer high resale value, they also come with increased competition and inflated prices. Investors should consider emerging markets like Valencia, Malaga, and some inland regions. These areas offer lower entry points, and their growing demand can lead to significant appreciation over the next few years (Dream Property Marbella) (Olive Press News Spain). Look for cities or regions with planned infrastructure improvements or where tourism is on the rise, as these factors will drive property prices upwards.

### Look for Bargain Properties Needing Renovation
